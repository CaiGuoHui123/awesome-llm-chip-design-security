# Awesome LLM Chip Design & Security

A curated reading list on LLM-driven chip design automation and hardware security, organized by:
**Intelligent EDA Closed-Loop (Generation–Optimization–Verification–Fixing) + Lifecycle Security (Design–Verification–Deployment/Operation)**.

## Taxonomy
### Part A. Intelligent EDA Closed-Loop
1) Spec Understanding & Architecture/RTL Generation  
2) Constraint Optimization & PPA Convergence  
3) Verification & Property Checking (incl. security properties)  
4) Defect Localization & Debugging/Fixing (incl. security defects)

### Part B. Lifecycle Security
- Design-time security (trojans/backdoors, secure coding, IP protection)
- Verification-time security (security assertions, formal, fuzzing)
- Deployment/Operation (monitoring, patching, supply chain, side-channel, etc.)
